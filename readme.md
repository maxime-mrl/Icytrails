# ❄️ Icytrails - community platformer game ❄️
## What is it?
IcyTrails is an open-source and in-browser platformer game with some ✨special✨ functionalities and physics: 
- For the <u>physics</u> part some **inertia** (or slipping on ice) is introduced: the more you move the faster you go and the higher you jump! 💨 and you can't stop immediately you need to slow down. **This allows creatives moves and level design** 💡
- The <u>Specials functionalities</u> are more one special functionality: **levels are created by the community** (just like Mario maker) with a built-in level editor you can change everything  concerning the level like:
  - Blocks placement (*obviously*)
  - Decorations
  - Level length
  - Spawn point
  - End point
  - Checkpoints (you can put as many checkpoints as you want)
  - Coins (for unnecessary  score)
  - Visibility of your level (public or unlisted)

With all these possibilities and the special physics, you can really get creative and create an **unique level**!
