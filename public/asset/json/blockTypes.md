# block types
*Blocks are identified by code from 0 to 100 (with space left for new blocks)*

**Each category of blocks have their own code range shown as bellow:**
- `00-19` solid
- `20-29` solid from top
- `30-69` background / decoration (no interaction)
- `70-79` kill on colision (spikes)
- `80-94` other and overflowed category (kind of potential more future proofing)
- `95-99` not rendered (will enter in other category for editor)
